<h1>Iterative Closest Point - ICP</h1>
<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>We first create two sets of toy dataset.</li>
        <li>We will call the first set of points the base points and will generate them using the latin hypercube sampling method</li>
        <div class="figure">

            <p>Figure 1: set of base point.</p>
        </div>
          <li>As you can see there are no two points in a row or a column.</li>
          <li>Then we define 2 functions for Rotation and Translation and apply that to the base point to get a second set of points.</li>
          <div class="figure">
            <img width="437" height="355" alt="figure of inventors of BFGS"
            src="./figures/source_points.png" />
            <p>Figure 2: both sets of points.</p>
          </div>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>What are we going to do?</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Now we are going to find the transformation that mapped base points (reference point sets) to the second transformed set of points aka. source point set.</li>
        <li>In order to do that we have to find a first estimate of the pair of points and the transformation between them.</li>
        <li>A good way to initialize our guess is to find the closest point to each point in the reference point set.</li>
        <li>After finding the closest point, we have to calculate the transformation that can map the point in reference set to that closest point of last step.</li>
        <li>In order to do that we have to first formulate the problem into a least square minimization problem because it has many robust and fast methods to solve and easier too!</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Here you can see the trajectory of the transformation for each point</li>
